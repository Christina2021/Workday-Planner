## Description

This is a planner that you may use to organize your workday!  Being provided with start HTML and CSS files, functionality was added to this site using JavaScript, jQuery, and Moment.js!  The planner will include rows by the hour, between a standard workday of 8am to 5pm!

## Usage

Once the site opens up, you will be able to see the current date and time at the top of the site.  Below, there will be a row for each hour between the hours of 8am to 5pm.  Below are the steps you may take for this site:

‚≠ê To add content, the middle columns of each row will have a textbox in which you may enter in content.\
‚≠ê Once you have finished adding content, you may click on the save button to the right of the row to keep the content saved (to your localStorage).  This will keep your content saved even if you refresh or navigate away from the page.\
‚≠ê To remove content, you may simply delete out the content that you had written, and then save once it has been deleted.


## What I Learned üí≠
I had to learn a lot about moment.js before beginning this assignment.  I had attempted to begin the assignment after reviewing some of the moment.js docs, but I was having a difficult time.  Once I had researched further into it through additional resources, as well as some practice, I was able to understand moment.js much easier and did not have too much trouble adding it into my site.\
I also had to research more into local Storage this time.  When I had created my JS Code Quiz site, I had added my scores to an object before adding it to local Storage.  However, after much trial-and-error with this site, I had decided against using an object and realized that the items could be added to local Storage separately.  Once I had changed my code based on this idea, I was able to successfully save to the local Storage and remove specific items from it.
